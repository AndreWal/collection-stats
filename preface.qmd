This preface explains why the book exists and how it is organized.

## Prerequisites

High school level math. It is helpful if you have some experience with R so you understand the code snippets, but it is not necessary to understand the issues that I try to address in this book.

## How to use this book

All data used in this book is simulated. Even though the goal of the book is not to demonstrate how to use a statistical software, code snippets are included to illustrate how to implement the methods discussed in the book. The code is written in R, but the concepts can be applied in other programming languages as well. The code snippets are meant to be illustrative and are not intended to be comprehensive or optimized for performance. Readers are encouraged to experiment with the code and adapt it to their own needs.
